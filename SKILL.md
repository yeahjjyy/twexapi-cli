# twexapi-cli

Use this skill when the task should be completed by running `twexapi` commands instead of re-implementing request logic by hand.

## Use this skill when

- the user wants to install or run the `twexapi` CLI
- the user wants to configure an API key, cookie, or `auth_token`
- the user wants to test or inspect requests with `--dry-run`
- the user wants to call supported twexapi commands for users, tweets, search, followers, following, lists, or follow actions
- the user knows an endpoint path and wants to call it through the generic `twexapi <path>` form

Do not treat this skill as the main interface when the task is to edit the CLI source code itself.

## Default approach

1. Confirm the CLI is available.
2. Make sure an app config or API key is available for read requests.
3. Make sure a saved profile or explicit cookie is available for write requests.
4. Prefer convenience commands first.
5. Fall back to `twexapi <path>` only when no convenience command fits.
6. Use `--dry-run` before real write actions unless the user explicitly asks to execute them.

## Install and run

For normal users, prefer the published npm package:

```bash
npm install -g twexapi-cli
twexapi --help
```

When working from this repository:

```bash
node ./bin/twexapi.js --help
```

If a local executable is needed while developing:

```bash
npm link
twexapi --help
```

Requires Node.js 18 or newer.

## Auth rules

- API keys come from `https://twexapi.io/dashboard`.
- For one-off commands, `TWEXAPI_KEY` or `--api-key` is acceptable.
- For repeated usage, prefer saved app configs with `auth apps add`.
- For write actions, require either `--cookie` or a saved profile.
- If a write action is requested without a usable profile or cookie, stop and ask for auth details instead of guessing.

App setup:

```bash
twexapi auth apps add --name prod --api-key "twitterx_..."
twexapi auth apps use prod
```

Profile setup from cookie:

```bash
twexapi auth profiles add --name founder --cookie "ct0=...; auth_token=..."
twexapi auth profiles use founder
```

Profile setup from auth token:

```bash
twexapi auth cookie --auth-token "your_auth_token" --save-as founder
```

Inspect config:

```bash
twexapi config show
twexapi config path
```

## Command selection

Prefer convenience commands such as:

```bash
twexapi --app prod about elonmusk
twexapi --app prod users elonmusk sama
twexapi --app prod search users "openai" --count 20
twexapi --app prod tweet lookup 1900000000000000000
```

Use the generic path form when the endpoint is known but not wrapped:

```bash
twexapi /twitter/elonmusk/about
twexapi -X POST -d '["elonmusk","sama"]' /twitter/users
```

## Safety and execution rules

- Put global options such as `--app`, `--profile`, `--api-key`, and `--dry-run` before the command.
- For write actions like `tweet create`, `tweet like`, `user follow`, and `list create`, prefer `--dry-run` first.
- Only send the real write request after the user clearly wants execution.
- The CLI masks secrets in config output and dry-run previews, but still avoid echoing raw credentials back to the user.
- Local media file upload is not implemented; tweet creation supports `--media-url`.
- DM commands are not included.

## Recommended test flow

Use an isolated config directory for local testing:

```bash
twexapi --config-dir ./.twexapi-local config show
```

Recommended order:

1. Verify the CLI starts with `twexapi --help` or `node ./bin/twexapi.js --help`.
2. Verify a read command such as `about` or `users`.
3. Verify a raw-path request if needed.
4. Verify write-command request construction with `--dry-run` before any real write action.
